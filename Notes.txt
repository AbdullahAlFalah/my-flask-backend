*Create a Virtual Environment (Venv): This keeps your project dependencies isolated from other Python projects:
# On Windows (Command Propmt)
- python -m venv venv

*Activate the Venv:
# On Windows (Command Prompt)
- Either cd then run the .bat or from the project root folder run the next command...
- venv\Scripts\activate.bat
- You'll know it's active because you'll see (venv) at the start of your terminal prompt.

*Next: Install Flask using this command: pip install Flask
*Generate requirements.txt command (optional, but good practice): pip freeze > requirements.txt (This file lists all your dependencies)

*Run the Application from your project's root directory command: python app.py (Access it in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000)
- or the standard Flask command: flask --app app run
